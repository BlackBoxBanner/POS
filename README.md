This web-based Point of Sale (POS) project is a term assignment assigned by CPE334 - Software Engineering. In this project, I have developed a modern and user-friendly web application designed to streamline and enhance the retail sales process. With a focus on efficiency and ease of use, this POS system provides essential features for businesses to manage inventory, process transactions, and track sales data.
